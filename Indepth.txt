Thus far, we have been seeing a very particular type of Requests and Responses in our applications. 
The requests were always a request, sent by the browser;  when we submitted a form, entered a URL or 
clicked a link or button. And the redirect was always either a redirect or an html page.
But, there are some operartions like deleting an item which happens behind the scene and no html page is 
returned and only some exchange of data takes place between the client and the server.

Current Work flow:-
Rightnow, for deleting a product, we click on the delete button and with that, a request is sent to the node sever,
containing the _id of the product. After that, with that _id, the node server reaches the database server and finds and deletes
that product. And then, a new html page is returned to the client, containing all the updated products.

Note:- There is nothing wrong with the current setup. But it would be a better user experience, if on clicking the delete button,
the page don't reloads and we could see the updated products on the very same page.

How it works:-
In Async requests, client sends some data to the server in the form of JSON. Then, upon completing the operation, the server
sends back some JSON to the client.
So, here we can send some JSON to the server on clicking the delete button and then, after successfully deleting the data 
on the database, the node severs will send some success msg as JSON, and then, we could delete the element from the DOM, on the
client side. 

The browser knows and sends only two types of requests to the server, i.e. GET and POST, on form submition, clicking link and buttons
However, when we send request through client side Javascript, we have access to other http verbs too.
